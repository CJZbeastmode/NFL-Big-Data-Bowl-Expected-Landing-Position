# NFL Big Data Bowl: Expected Landing Position

NFL has been one of the most popular sports in the United States and in the world. The sport, football, mainly consists of three play types: offense, defence and special team plays. For a long time, offense and defence are overwhelmingly emphasized on the field, since these two play types directly enable teams to evaluate their performances and achieve victories. Nevertheless special team plays, especially punting, is often overlooked due to the fact that many people believe that it is only the complementary part of the game. Does punting indeed affect the game and the players on the pitch?

In this notebook, I am going to introduce a new metric called "Expected Landing Position" for a punted football. The function of this metric is to predict the approximate landing position on x and y axis of a punted football based on several selected features that can be extracted from the datasets provided. In order to calculate the "Expected Landing Position", I am going to build a machine learning model. This model enables NFL coaching staff and returners to input a set of features and it will return the displacement of the football on both x and y axis as the result. With this new metric and machine learning model, NFL teams and returners are able to know the rough position of a landed football, so that they could perform better at returning and achieve better returning yardage, which could be vital to a game.
